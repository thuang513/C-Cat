/**
 * This interface represents a single instance of a Synonym Set ({@link Synset}
 * for short) from the WordNet dictionary.  A {@link Synset} is composed of
 * several {@link Lemma}s that have a word sense, or meaning, that is the same.
 * Each {@link Synset} can be connected to other {@link Synset}s through a
 * {@link Relation}.  Different {@link PartsOfSpeech} utilize different sets of
 * relations. 
 *
 * </p>
 * 
 * </p>
 *
 * A {@link Synset} has several key attributes: 
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> A name that specifies the first lemma for the {@link Synset}, it's
 * {@link PartsOfSpeech}, and the sense number for the first {@link Lemma}, for
 * example "cat.n.01"</li>
 * <li> A dictionary gloss that explicates the concept represented by the
 * {@link Synset}</li>
 * <li> A set of example sentences for the lemmas in the {@link Synset}</li>
 * <li> A set of relations to other {@link Synset}s, which are keyed by a
 * {@link Relation}</li>
 * <li> A set of parent {@link Synset}s.  These are called Hypernyms for nouns
 * and verbs.  For all parts of speech, these are accessed using the {@link
 * Relation#HYPERNYM} relation.  Parent {@link Synset}s are more concepts, for
 * example "building" is a parent concept of "home".  Calling {@link getParents}
 * is equivalent to calling {@link getRelations} with {@link Relation#HYPERNYM}
 * as the relation argument.</li>
 * <li> A set of child {@link Synset}s.  These are called Hyponyms for nouns
 * and Troponyms for verbs.  For all parts of speech, these are accessed using
 * the {@link Relation#HYPONYM} relation.  Child {@link Synset}s are more
 * specific concecpts, for example "cat" is a child concept of "animal".
 * Calling {@link getChildren} is equivalent to calling {@link getRelations}
 * with {@link Relation#HYPONYM} as the relation argument.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * </p>
 * All {@link Synset}s are stored in memory and are connected as a graph.  Any
 * traversal operations should not make the assumption that the graph is
 * acyclic.
